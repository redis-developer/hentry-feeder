Hentry, is a hackathon sentry that allows organizers to provide a fair competing platform in the online events. Since plagiarism and re-use are the major problems in such submissions which ruins the spirit of hackathons,  It utilizes intelligent algorithms to calculate project entropy and snapshots of participants' projects in real-time and visualizes the same for the organizers as a live graph in a pleasant user interface.


## Components

- [Hentry Server](https://github.com/YashKumarVerma/hentry-server) : web server written in TypeScript to act as the service to expose data for hentry-dashboards. Provides routes which utilize Redis-JSON and Redis-TimesSeries to return data for business logic. Handle user creation, team creation, initial dashboard data fetch and polling updates for live graphs.
- [Hentry Client](https://github.com/YashKumarVerma/hentry-client) : CLI written in Golang utilizing go-routines for performance âš¡ which calculates project entropy and snapshots and emits them to hentry-feeder

- [Hentry Feeder](https://github.com/YashKumarVerma/hentry-feeder) : micro service written in GoLang utilizing go-routines for performance, exposes a simple HTTP server to accept requests from henry-client instances running on participants' devices and write data to Redis TimeSeries Database.
-  [Hentry Dashboard](https://github.com/YashKumarVerma/hentry-dashboard) : a responsive and dynamic single page application build using React and TailWind CSS, designed in a monochrome and minimal UI to focus on important data. Also provisions realtime graphs which render live feed of project status.

## Hentry Client

- Generates a unique signature of each machine, used to uniquely identify machine.
- Allows user to log into hentry servers, create and join teams, and register devices.
- Can identity old devices and avoid duplicate logins, based on device signatures.
- Interactive command line interface, with indicators showing validation results.
- Written implementing go-routines, utilizes minimal system resources, non blocking.
- Creates an internal directory mapping as hashmap and transmits data to hentry-server
- Written in Golang, can be compiled for any operating system and architecture.
- Deployment configurations embedded into binary, just run on terminal and use. If required, can pass data into binary for custom configurations.
- Who uses this
  - The participants of the event are supposed to place this in their project directory. That's all they are required to do.
- Compiling Again?
  - open hentry-client, then run `make build` and you'll get your binary in the `build folder`
- ToDo
  - add encryption to allow secure communication and no tampering of data.

Picks up device name by itself

Now the client will automatically calculate snapshot score and entropy of all directories which are child of the directory in which hentry-client is present.


## Hentry Server

- Hentry Server is written in typescript with modern tooling to quickly prototype the application.
- The server is available on docker hub as yashkumarverma[](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/yashkumarverma/hentry-server)/hentry-server
- Connects to reddismod instance and ensures that connection with json and timeseries module is made.
- Provides routes for team formation, team joining, device registration, fetching all timeseries data and polling for updates in timeseries data.
- To run locally, run `yarn install` then `yarn start:dev` or use the docker image.
- Follows a uniform logging scheme to make it easier to debug.
- Supports keywords like `now` to fetch all data till the present timestamp.
- Divided into modules and services keep related codebase together and therefore make it easier to maintain.
- Configurations can be accessed in `config` directory.

## Hentry Feeder

![https://i.imgur.com/gXnIxAV.png](https://i.imgur.com/gXnIxAV.png)

- Hentry feeder is a tiny microservice, designed to run in clusters depending upon the number of participants on the system.
- Only purpose is to inject data received from the clients (hentry-client which can go upto thousands in number depending on event) into redis timeseries database.
- To compile manually, run `make build` or compile `internal/main.go` for your architecture.
- Also available as a docker container : [yashkumarverma/hentry-feeder](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/yashkumarverma/hentry-feeder)

## Hentry Dashboard

![https://i.imgur.com/AFGOWdM.png](https://i.imgur.com/AFGOWdM.png)
- main interface that is used by event organizers.
- clean, minimal ui
- option to search via team ID in landing page

![https://i.imgur.com/PebX7cQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/PebX7cQ.png)

- shows the friendly name of each device in team, and also their platforms.

- When a device a hovered 
![https://i.imgur.com/Nqp6ecN.png](https://i.imgur.com/Nqp6ecN.png)

- opening the details of any device shows a live graph of project snapshot and entropy.

## Deployment
after running respective docker images, something like this should be accessible. or you can use the hosted docker images directly instead of building them manually.

The images are
- yashkumarverma/hentry-server
- yashkumarverma/hentry-feeder
- redismod
